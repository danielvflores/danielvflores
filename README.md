# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Daniel Flores Viera**, a **Computer Science and Engineering** student with a passion for backend development and building efficient, scalable systems.

I'm a constant learner in the world of programming, always striving to improve my skills day by day. I'm especially interested in software architecture, API design, and database management.

## 🛠️ Technologies I have experience with

- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **Java**
- **Databases** (MongoDB - JSON - NOSQL)
- **REST APIs and WebSockets**

## ⚡ Highlighted Projects
- [**mc-discord-ws**](https://github.com/danielvflores/discord-api-connection) ✅
- [**type-bot**](https://github.com/danielvflores/type-bot) ✅

The first project is a connection system between a Minecraft server's chat and a predefined Discord channel, using a REST API built with TypeScript, Express, Cors, WebSoket and Java.
The second project is a Discord bot developed entirely in TypeScript.

## ⚡ Ongoing Projects

## 🎯 Focus

Although I've explored various areas, I identify most with **backend development**, where I can focus on logic, performance, and structural organization of applications.
